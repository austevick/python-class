## Getting Started
+++

Python is a dynamic language. There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in the source code.

The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The [Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit |
- Simple is better than complex |
- Complex is better than complicated |
- Readability counts |
