## Loops
+++
There are two different types of loops in Python, for loops and while loops
```
list = [1,2,3,4]
for num in list:
    print num

x = True
while x:
    print 'Yay!'
```
@[2](A for loop is essentially a for each loop in other languages)
@[2](It will go through each element in the sequence and assign the current item to the local scoped variable..i.e. num)
