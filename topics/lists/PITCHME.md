## Lists
+++
Python has a built-in list type called "list". Lists are written within square brackets "[]". Lists and strings work similarly in the sense they both use the len() function and square brackets [ ] to access data, with the first element at index 0.
```
colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green']
print colors[0]
>>> red
print colors[2]
>>> green
print len(colors)
>>> 3
```
