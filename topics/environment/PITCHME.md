## Environment Setup

### Setting Up Python
Setting up python will be different depending on your operating system

+++
To have a good development environment, we will need 3 things:
- An installed version of python
- An installed version of pip |
- An installed version of virtualenv |
- An installed Text Editor or IDE |

+++
For Mac and Linux, you should already have python installed. You can verify this by running:
```
my-laptop:~ austevick$ python -V
Python 2.7.13
my-laptop:~ austevick$
```
